# Platyfend-CI

Platyfend-CI is the CI-CD extension of the code review tool Platyfend (https://www.platyfend.com/index.html#hero), which you can use directly from your Github repository, creating, in consequence, an efficient and rapid way of checking the code for vulnerabilities.

For the setup, please refer to https://www.platyfend.com/ci-cd-guide.html.
Once the setup procedure is complete, the tool will automatically generate a report on the file diffs for every new push.

The first generated report will incorporate all the python code in the repo. The subsequent reports will come as a completion.
